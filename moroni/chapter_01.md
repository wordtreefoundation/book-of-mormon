**Moroni 1:1** Now I Moroni after having made an end of abridging the account of the people of Jared, I had supposed to not have written more, but I have not as yet perished. And I make not myself known to the Lamanites lest they should destroy me.

**Moroni 1:2** For behold, their wars are exceeding fierce among themselves. And because of their hatred they put to death every Nephite that will not deny the Christ.

**Moroni 1:3** And I Moroni will not deny the Christ; wherefore I wander whithersoever I can for the safety of mine own life.

**Moroni 1:4** Wherefore I write a few more things, contrary to that which I had supposed, for I had supposed not to have written any more. But I write a few more things, that perhaps they may be of worth unto my brethren the Lamanites in some future day, according to the will of the Lord.
