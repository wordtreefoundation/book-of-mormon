**Alma 50:1** And now it came to pass that or to defend themselves against the Lamanites, for he caused that his armies should commence in the commencement of the twentieth year of the reign of the judges that they should commence in digging up heaps of earth round about all the cities throughout all the land which was possessed by the Nephites.

**Alma 50:2** And upon the top of those ridges of earth he caused that there should be timbers, yea, works of timbers built up to the heighth of a man, round about the cities.

**Alma 50:3** And he caused that upon those works of timbers that there should be a frame of pickets built upon the timbers round about; and they were strong and high.

**Alma 50:4** And he caused towers to be erected that overlooked those works of pickets; and he caused places of security to be built upon those towers, that the stones and the arrows of the Lamanites could not hurt them.

**Alma 50:5** And they were prepared that they could cast stones from the top thereof, according to their pleasure and their strength, and slay him which should attempt to approach near the walls of the city.

**Alma 50:6** Thus Moroni did prepare strong holds against the coming of their enemies round about every city in all the land.

**Alma 50:7** And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his armies should go forth into the east wilderness. Yea, and they went forth and drave all the Lamanites which were in the east wilderness into their own lands, which were south of the land of Zarahemla.

**Alma 50:8** And the land of Nephi did run in a straight course from the east sea to the west.

**Alma 50:9** And it came to pass that when Moroni had driven all the Lamanites out of the east wilderness, which was north of the lands of their own possessions, he caused that the inhabitants which were in the land of Zarahemla and in the land round about should go forth into the east wilderness, even to the borders by the seashore, and possess the land.

**Alma 50:10** And he also placed armies on the south in the borders of their possessions and caused them to erect fortifications that they might secure their armies and their people from the hands of their enemies.

**Alma 50:11** And thus he cut off all the strong holds of the Lamanites in the east wilderness, yea, and also on the west, fortifying the line between the Nephites and the Lamanites, between the land of Zarahemla and the land of Nephi, from the west sea running by the head of the river Sidon, the Nephites possessing all the land northward, yea, even all the land which was northward of the land Bountiful, according to their pleasure.

**Alma 50:12** Thus Moroni with his armies--which did increase daily because of the assurance of protection which his works did bring forth unto them--therefore they did seek to cut off the strength and the power of the Lamanites from off the lands of their possessions, that they should have no power upon the lands of their possessions.

**Alma 50:13** And it came to pass that the Nephites began the foundation of a city, and they called the name of the city Moroni. And it was by the east sea; and it was on the south by the line of the possessions of the Lamanites.

**Alma 50:14** And they also began a foundation for a city between the city of Moroni and the city of Aaron, joining the borders of Aaron and Moroni, and they called the name of the city, or the land, Nephihah.

**Alma 50:15** And they also began in that same year to build many cities on the north, one in a particular manner which they called Lehi, which was in the north by the borders of the seashore.

**Alma 50:16** And thus ended the twentieth year.

**Alma 50:17** And in these prosperous circumstances were the people of Nephi in the commencement of the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

**Alma 50:18** And they did prosper exceedingly, and they became exceeding rich. Yea, and they did multiply and wax strong in the land.

**Alma 50:19** And thus we see how merciful and just are all the dealings of the Lord, to the fulfilling of all his words unto the children of men. Yea, we can behold that his words are verified, even at this time, which he spake unto Lehi, saying:

**Alma 50:20** Blessed art thou and thy children. And they shall be blessed! And inasmuch as they shall keep my commandments, they shall prosper in the land. But remember, inasmuch as they will not keep my commandments, they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.

**Alma 50:21** And we see that these promises have been verified to the people of Nephi; for it has been their quarrelings and their contentions, yea, their murderings and their plunderings, their idolatry and their whoredoms and their abominations which were among themselves, which brought upon them their wars and their destructions.

**Alma 50:22** And those who were faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord were delivered at all times, whilst thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage or to perish by the sword or to dwindle in unbelief and mingle with the Lamanites.

**Alma 50:23** But behold, there never was a happier time among the people of Nephi since the days of Nephi than in the days of Moroni, yea, even at this time, in the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges.

**Alma 50:24** And it came to pass that the twenty and second year of the reign of the judges also ended in peace, yea, and also the twenty and third year.

**Alma 50:25** And it came to pass that in the commencement of the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the judges, there would also have been peace among the people of Nephi had it not been for a contention which took place among them concerning the land of Lehi and the land of Morionton, which joined upon the borders of Lehi, both of which were on the borders by the seashore.

**Alma 50:26** For behold, the people which possessed the land of Morionton did claim a part of the land of Lehi. Therefore there began to be a warm contention between them, insomuch that the people of Morionton took up arms against their brethren; and they were determined by the sword to slay them.

**Alma 50:27** But behold, the people which possessed the land of Lehi fled to the camp of Moroni and appealed unto him for assistance; for behold, they were not in the wrong.

**Alma 50:28** And it came to pass that when the people of Morionton, which were led by a man whose name was Morionton, found that the people of Lehi had fled to the camp of Moroni, they were exceeding fearful lest the army of Moroni should come upon them and destroy them.

**Alma 50:29** Therefore Morionton put it into their hearts that they should flee to the land which was northward, which was covered with large bodies of water, and take possession of the land which was northward.

**Alma 50:30** And behold, they would have carried this plan into an effect--which would have been a cause to have been lamented--but behold, Morionton being a man of much passion, therefore he was angry with one of his maidservants, and he fell upon her and beat her much.

**Alma 50:31** And it came to pass that she fled and came over to the camp of Moroni and told Moroni all things concerning the matter and also concerning their intentions to flee into the land northward.

**Alma 50:32** Now behold, the people which were in the land of Bountiful--or rather Moroni feared that they would hearken to the words of Morionton and unite with his people, and thus he would obtain possession of those parts of the land, which would lay a foundation for serious consequences among the people of Nephi, yea, which consequences would lead to the overthrow of their liberty--

**Alma 50:33** therefore Moroni sent an army with their camp to head the people of Morionton, to stop their flight into the land northward.

**Alma 50:34** And it came to pass that they did not head them until they had came to the borders of the land Desolation. And there they did head them by the narrow pass which led by the sea into the land northward, yea, by the sea on the west and on the east.

**Alma 50:35** And it came to pass that the army which was sent by Moroni, which was led by a man whose name was Teancum, did meet the people of Morionton. And so stubborn were the people of Morionton, being inspired by his wickedness and his flattering words, that a battle commenced between them, in the which Teancum did slay Morionton and defeat his army and took them prisoners and returned to the camp of Moroni. And thus ended the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

**Alma 50:36** And thus was the people of Morionton brought back. And upon their covenanting to keep the peace, they were restored to the land of Morionton. And a union took place between them and the people of Lehi, and they were also restored to their lands.

**Alma 50:37** And it came to pass that in that same year that the people of Nephi had peace restored unto them that Nephihah the second chief judge died, having filled the judgment seat with perfect uprightness before God.

**Alma 50:38** Nevertheless he had refused Alma to take possession of those records and those things which were esteemed by Alma and his fathers to be most sacred. Therefore Alma had conferred them upon his son Helaman.

**Alma 50:39** Behold, it came to pass that the son of Nephihah was appointed to fill the judgment seat in the stead of his father. Yea, he was appointed chief judge and governor over the people, with an oath and sacred ordinance to judge righteously, and to keep the peace and the freedom of the people, and to grant unto them their sacred privileges to worship the Lord their God, yea, to support and maintain the cause of God all his days, and to bring the wicked to justice according to their crime.

**Alma 50:40** Now behold, his name was Parhoron. And Parhoron did fill the seat of his father and did commence his reign in the end of the twenty and fourth year over the people of Nephi.
