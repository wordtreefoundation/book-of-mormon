**Alma 26:1** And now these are the words of Ammon to his brethren, which saith thus: My brothers and my brethren, behold, I say unto you: How great reason have we to rejoice! For could we have supposed when we started from the land of Zarahemla that God would have granted unto us such great blessings?

**Alma 26:2** And now I ask: What great blessings hath he bestowed upon us? Can ye tell?

**Alma 26:3** Behold, I answer for you: For our brethren the Lamanites were in darkness, yea, even in the darkest abyss. But behold, how many of them are brought to behold the marvelous light of God! And this is the blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that we have been made instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work.

**Alma 26:4** Behold, thousands of them do rejoice and have been brought into the fold of God.

**Alma 26:5** Behold, the field was ripe. And blessed are ye, for ye did thrust in the sickle and did reap with your mights; yea, all the day long did ye labor--and behold the number of your sheaves! And they shall be gathered into the garners, that they are not wasted.

**Alma 26:6** Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day. Yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh, they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them. Yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them.

**Alma 26:7** But behold, they are in the hands of the Lord of the harvest. And they are his, and he will raise them up at the last day.

**Alma 26:8** Blessed be the name of our God! Let us sing to his praise; yea, let us give thanks to his holy name, for he doth work righteousness forever.

**Alma 26:9** For if we had not come up out of the land of Zarahemla, these our dearly beloved brethren, which have so dearly beloved us, would still have been racked with hatred against us. Yea, and they would also have been strangers to God.

**Alma 26:10** And it came to pass that when Ammon had said these words, his brother Aaron rebuked him, saying: Ammon, I fear that thy joy doth carry thee away unto boasting.

**Alma 26:11** But Ammon saith unto him: I do not boast in my own strength or in my own wisdom; but behold, my joy is full. Yea, my heart is brim with joy, and I will rejoice in my God.

**Alma 26:12** Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength, I am weak. Therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God; for in his strength I can do all things. Yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise his name forever.

**Alma 26:13** Behold how many thousands of our brethren hath he loosed from the pains of hell! And they are brought to sing redeeming love--and this because of the power of his word which is in us. Therefore have we not great reason to rejoice?

**Alma 26:14** Yea, we have reason to praise him forever, for he is the Most High God and has loosed these our brethren from the chains of hell.

**Alma 26:15** Yea, they were encircled about with everlasting darkness and destruction; but behold, he hath brought them into his everlasting light, yea, into everlasting salvation. And they are encircled about with the matchless bounty of his love. Yea, and we have been instruments in his hands of doing this great and marvelous work.

**Alma 26:16** Therefore let us glory. Yea, we will glory in the Lord; yea, we will rejoice, for our joy is full; yea, we will praise our God forever. Behold, who can glory too much in the Lord? Yea, who can say too much of his great power and of his mercy and of his long-suffering towards the children of men? Behold, I say unto you: I cannot say the smallest part which I feel.

**Alma 26:17** Who could have supposed that our God would have been so merciful as to have snatched us from our awful, sinful, and polluted state?

**Alma 26:18** Behold, we went forth even in wrath with mighty threatenings to destroy his church.

**Alma 26:19** O then why did he not consign us to an awful destruction? Yea, why did he not let the sword of his justice fall upon us and doom us to eternal despair?

**Alma 26:20** O my soul almost, as it were, fleeth at the thought. Behold, he did not exercise his justice upon us, but in his great mercy hath brought us over that everlasting gulf of death and misery, even to the salvation of our souls.

**Alma 26:21** And now behold, my brethren, what natural man is there that knoweth these things? I say unto you: There is none that knoweth these things save it be the penitent.

**Alma 26:22** Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith and bringeth forth good works and prayeth continually without ceasing, unto such it is given to know the mysteries of God. Yea, unto such it shall be given to reveal things which never have been revealed. Yea, and it shall be given unto such to bring thousands of souls to repentance, even as it hath been given unto us to bring these our brethren to repentance.

**Alma 26:23** Now, do ye remember, my brethren, that we said unto our brethren in the land of Zarahemla: We go up to the land of Nephi to preach unto our brethren the Lamanites. And they laughed us to scorn,

**Alma 26:24** for they said unto us: Do ye suppose that ye can bring the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth? Do ye suppose that ye can convince the Lamanites of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers, as stiffnecked a people as they are, whose hearts delighteth in the shedding of blood, whose days have been spent in the grossest iniquity, whose ways have been the ways of a transgressor from the beginning? Now my brethren, ye remember that this was their language.

**Alma 26:25** And moreover they did say: Let us take up arms against them, that we destroy them and their iniquity out of the land, lest they overrun us and destroy us.

**Alma 26:26** But behold, my beloved brethren, we came into the wilderness, not with the intent to destroy our brethren, but with the intent that perhaps we might save some few of their souls.

**Alma 26:27** Now when our hearts were depressed and we were about to turn back, behold, the Lord comforted us and said: Go amongst thy brethren, the Lamanites, and bear with patience thine afflictions; and I will give unto thee success.

**Alma 26:28** And now behold, we have come and been forth amongst them; and we have been patient in our sufferings. And we have suffered every privation; yea, we have traveled from house to house, relying upon the mercies of the world--not upon the mercies of the world alone, but upon the mercies of God.

**Alma 26:29** And we have entered into their houses and taught them; and we have taught them in their streets; yea, and we have taught them upon their hills; and we have also entered into their temples and their synagogues and taught them. And we have been cast out and mocked and spit upon and smote upon our cheeks. And we have been stoned and taken and bound with strong cords and cast into prison; and through the power and wisdom of God we have been delivered again.

**Alma 26:30** And we have suffered all manner of afflictions--and all this that perhaps we might be the means of saving some soul. And we supposed that our joy would be full if perhaps we could be the means of saving some.

**Alma 26:31** Now behold, we can look forth and see the fruits of our labors. And are they few? I say unto you: Nay, they are many. Yea, and we can witness of their sincerity because of their love towards their brethren and also towards us.

**Alma 26:32** For behold, they had rather sacrifice their lives than even to take the life of their enemy. And they have buried their weapons of war deep in the earth because of their love towards their brethren.

**Alma 26:33** And now behold, I say unto you: Has there been so great love in all the land? Behold, I say unto you: Nay. There has not, even among the Nephites.

**Alma 26:34** For behold, they would take up arms against their brethren; they would not suffer themselves to be slain. But behold, how many of these have laid down their lives! And we know that they have gone to their God because of their love and of their hatred to sin.

**Alma 26:35** Now, have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you: There never was men that had so great reason to rejoice as we since the world began. Yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God. For he has all power, all wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is a merciful Being, even unto salvation to those who will repent and believe on his name.

**Alma 26:36** Now if this is boasting, even so will I boast. For this is my life and my light, my joy and my salvation and my redemption from everlasting woe. Yea, blessed is the name of my God, who hath been mindful of this people, which are a branch of the tree of Israel and hath been lost from its body in a strange land. Yea, I say: Blessed be the name of my God, who hath been mindful of us, wanderers in a strange land.

**Alma 26:37** Now my brethren, we see that God is mindful of every people in whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people. And his bowels of mercy is over all the earth. Now this is my joy and my great thanksgiving. Yea, and I will give thanks unto my God forever. Amen.
