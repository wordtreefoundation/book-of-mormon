**2 Nephi 5:1** Behold, it came to pass that I Nephi did cry much unto the Lord my God because of the anger of my brethren.

**2 Nephi 5:2** But behold, their anger did increase against me, insomuch that they did seek to take away my life.

**2 Nephi 5:3** Yea, they did murmur against me, saying: Our younger brother thinketh to rule over us, and we have had much trial because of him. Wherefore now let us slay him, that we may not be afflicted more because of his words. For behold, we will not that he shall be our ruler, for it belongeth unto us which are the elder brethren to rule over this people.

**2 Nephi 5:4** Now I do not write upon these plates all the words which they murmured against me, but it sufficeth me to say that they did seek to take away my life.

**2 Nephi 5:5** And it came to pass that the Lord did warn me that I Nephi should depart from them and flee into the wilderness, and all they which would go with me.

**2 Nephi 5:6** Wherefore it came to pass that I Nephi did take my family, and also Zoram and his family, and Sam mine elder brother and his family, and Jacob and Joseph, my younger brethren, and also my sisters, and all they which would go with me. And all they which would go with me were they which believed in the warnings and the revelations of God; wherefore they did hearken unto my words.

**2 Nephi 5:7** And we did take our tents and whatsoever things were possible for us and did journey in the wilderness for the space of many days. And after that we had journeyed for the space of many days, we did pitch our tents.

**2 Nephi 5:8** And my people would that we should call the name of the place Nephi; wherefore we did call it Nephi.

**2 Nephi 5:9** And all they which were with me did take it upon them to call themselves the people of Nephi.

**2 Nephi 5:10** And we did observe to keep the judgments and the statutes and the commandments of the Lord, in all things according to the law of Moses.

**2 Nephi 5:11** And the Lord was with us and we did prosper exceedingly, for we did sow seed and we did reap again in abundance. And we began to raise flocks and herds and animals of every kind.

**2 Nephi 5:12** And I Nephi had also brought the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, and also the ball or the compass which was prepared for my father by the hand of the Lord, according to that which is written.

**2 Nephi 5:13** And it came to pass that we began to prosper exceedingly and to multiply in the land.

**2 Nephi 5:14** And I Nephi did take the sword of Laban and after the manner of it did make many swords, lest by any means the people which were now called Lamanites should come upon us and destroy us. For I knew their hatred towards me and my children and they which were called my people.

**2 Nephi 5:15** And I did teach my people that they should build buildings and that they should work in all manner of wood and of iron and of copper and of brass and of steel and of gold and of silver and of precious ores, which were in great abundance.

**2 Nephi 5:16** And I Nephi did build a temple. And I did construct it after the manner of the temple of Solomon, save it were not built of so many precious things--for they were not to be found upon the land--wherefore it could not be built like unto Solomon's temple. But the manner of the construction was like unto the temple of Solomon, and the workmanship thereof was exceeding fine.

**2 Nephi 5:17** And it came to pass that I Nephi did cause my people that they should be industrious and that they should labor with their hands.

**2 Nephi 5:18** And it came to pass that they would that I should be their king, but I Nephi was desirous that they should have no king. Nevertheless I did do for them according to that which was in my power.

**2 Nephi 5:19** And behold, the words of the Lord had been fulfilled unto my brethren which he spake concerning them, that I should be their ruler and their teacher. Wherefore I had been their ruler and their teacher according to the commandments of the Lord until the time that they sought to take away my life.

**2 Nephi 5:20** Wherefore the word of the Lord was fulfilled which he spake unto me, saying that inasmuch as they will not hearken unto thy words, they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And behold, they were cut off from his presence.

**2 Nephi 5:21** And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint. Wherefore as they were white and exceeding fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people, therefore the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.

**2 Nephi 5:22** And thus saith the Lord God: I will cause that they shall be loathsome unto thy people save they shall repent of their iniquities.

**2 Nephi 5:23** And cursed shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their seed, for they shall be cursed even with the same cursing. And the Lord spake it, and it was done.

**2 Nephi 5:24** And because of their cursing which was upon them, they did become an idle people, full of mischief and subtlety, and did seek in the wilderness for beasts of prey.

**2 Nephi 5:25** And the Lord God said unto me: They shall be a scourge unto thy seed to stir them up in remembrance of me. And inasmuch as they will not remember me and hearken unto my words, they shall scourge them even unto destruction.

**2 Nephi 5:26** And it came to pass that I Nephi did consecrate Jacob and Joseph, that they should be priests and teachers over the land of my people.

**2 Nephi 5:27** And it came to pass that we lived after the manner of happiness.

**2 Nephi 5:28** And thirty years had passed away from the time we left Jerusalem.

**2 Nephi 5:29** And I Nephi had kept the records upon my plates which I had made of my people thus far.

**2 Nephi 5:30** And it came to pass that the Lord God said unto me: Make other plates; and thou shalt engraven many things upon them which are good in my sight for the profit of thy people.

**2 Nephi 5:31** Wherefore I Nephi, to be obedient to the commandments of the Lord, went and made these plates upon which I have engraven these things.

**2 Nephi 5:32** And I engravened that which is pleasing unto God. And if my people be pleased with the things of God, they be pleased with mine engravings which are upon these plates.

**2 Nephi 5:33** And if my people desire to know the more particular part of the history of my people, they must search mine other plates.

**2 Nephi 5:34** And it sufficeth me to say that forty years had passed away, and we had already had wars and contentions with our brethren.
