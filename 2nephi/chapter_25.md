**2 Nephi 25:1** Now I Nephi do speak somewhat concerning the words which I have written, which have been spoken by the mouth of Isaiah. For behold, Isaiah spake many things which were hard for many of my people to understand, for they know not concerning the manner of prophesying among the Jews.

**2 Nephi 25:2** For I Nephi have not taught them many things concerning the manner of the Jews, for their works were works of darkness and their doings were doings of abomination.

**2 Nephi 25:3** Wherefore I write unto my people, unto all they that shall receive hereafter these things which I write, that they may know the judgments of God, that they come upon all nations according to the word which he hath spoken.

**2 Nephi 25:4** Wherefore hearken, O my people which are of the house of Israel, and give ear unto my words, for because that the words of Isaiah are not plain unto you--nevertheless they are plain unto all they that are filled with the spirit of prophecy, but I give unto you a prophecy according to the Spirit which is in me--wherefore I shall prophesy according to the plainness which hath been with me from the time that I came out from Jerusalem with my father. For behold, my soul delighteth in plainness unto my people, that they may learn.

**2 Nephi 25:5** Yea, and my soul delighteth in the words of Isaiah, for I came out from Jerusalem and mine eyes hath beheld the things of the Jews. And I know that the Jews do understand the things of the prophets. And there is none other people that understand the things which were spoken unto the Jews like unto them, save it be that they are taught after the manner of the things of the Jews.

**2 Nephi 25:6** But behold, I Nephi have not taught my children after the manner of the Jews; but behold, I of myself have dwelt at Jerusalem, wherefore I know concerning the regions round about. And I have made mention concerning the judgments of God which hath come to pass among the Jews unto my children according to all that which Isaiah hath spoken, and I do not write them.

**2 Nephi 25:7** But behold, I proceed with mine own prophecy according to my plainness, in the which I know that no man can err. Nevertheless in the days that the prophecies of Isaiah shall be fulfilled, men shall know of a surety at the times when they shall come to pass.

**2 Nephi 25:8** Wherefore they are of worth unto the children of men. And he that supposeth that they are not, unto them will I speak particularly and confine the words unto mine own people, for I know that they shall be of great worth unto them in the last days, for in that day shall they understand them. Wherefore for their good have I written them.

**2 Nephi 25:9** And as one generation hath been destroyed among the Jews because of iniquity, even so have they been destroyed from generation to generation according to their iniquities. And never hath any of them been destroyed save it were foretold them by the prophets of the Lord.

**2 Nephi 25:10** Wherefore it hath been told them concerning the destruction which should come upon them immediately after my father left Jerusalem. Nevertheless they hardened their hearts; and according to my prophecy they have been destroyed, save it be those which are carried away captive into Babylon.

**2 Nephi 25:11** And now this I speak because of the Spirit which is in me. And notwithstanding that they have been carried away, they shall return again and possess the land of Jerusalem. Wherefore they shall be restored again to the lands of their inheritance.

**2 Nephi 25:12** But behold, they shall have wars and rumors of wars. And when the day cometh that the Only Begotten of the Father--yea, even the Father of heaven and of earth--shall manifest himself unto them in the flesh, behold, they will reject him because of their iniquities and the hardness of their hearts and the stiffness of their necks.

**2 Nephi 25:13** Behold, they will crucify him. And after that he is laid in a sepulchre for the space of three days, he shall rise from the dead with healing in his wings, and all they that shall believe on his name shall be saved in the kingdom of God. Wherefore my soul delighteth to prophesy concerning him, for I have seen his day, and my heart doth magnify his holy name.

**2 Nephi 25:14** And behold, it shall come to pass that after the Messiah hath risen from the dead and hath manifested himself unto his people, unto as many as will believe on his name, behold, Jerusalem shall be destroyed again; for woe unto them that fight against God and the people of his church.

**2 Nephi 25:15** Wherefore the Jews shall be scattered among all nations; yea, and also Babylon shall be destroyed. Wherefore the Jews shall be scattered by other nations.

**2 Nephi 25:16** And after that they have been scattered and the Lord God hath scourged them by other nations for the space of many generations--yea, even down from generation to generation until they shall be persuaded to believe in Christ the Son of God and the atonement, which is infinite for all mankind--and when that day shall come that they shall believe in Christ and worship the Father in his name with pure hearts and clean hands and look not forward any more for another Messiah--and then at that time the day will come that it must needs be expedient that they should believe these things--

**2 Nephi 25:18** Wherefore he shall bring forth his words unto them, which words shall judge them at the last day; for they shall be given them for the purpose of convincing them of the true Messiah, who was rejected by them, and unto the convincing of them that they need not look forward any more for a Messiah to come; for there should not any come save it should be a false Messiah which should deceive the people. For there is save one Messiah spoken of by the prophets, and that Messiah is he which should be rejected of the Jews.

**2 Nephi 25:19** For according to the words of the prophets, the Messiah cometh in six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem. And according to the words of the prophets and also the word of the angel of God, his name should be Jesus Christ the Son of God.

**2 Nephi 25:20** And now my brethren, I have spoken plain that ye cannot err. And as the Lord God liveth that brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt and gave unto Moses power that he should heal the nations after that they had been bitten by the poisonous serpents, if they would cast their eyes unto the serpent which he did raise up before them, and also gave him power that he should smite the rock and the water should come forth, yea, behold I say unto you that as these things are true and as the Lord God liveth, there is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ of which I have spoken whereby man can be saved.

**2 Nephi 25:21** Wherefore for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me that these things which I write shall be kept and preserved and handed down unto my seed from generation to generation, that the promise may be fulfilled unto Joseph that his seed should never perish as long as the earth should stand.

**2 Nephi 25:22** Wherefore these things shall go from generation to generation as long as the earth shall stand; and they shall go according to the will and pleasure of God. And the nations which shall possess them shall be judged of them according to the words which are written.

**2 Nephi 25:23** For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children and also our brethren to believe in Christ and to be reconciled to God, for we know that it is by grace that we are saved after all that we can do.

**2 Nephi 25:24** And notwithstanding we believe in Christ, we keep the law of Moses and look forward with steadfastness unto Christ until the law shall be fulfilled,

**2 Nephi 25:25** for for this end was the law given. Wherefore the law hath become dead unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of our faith, yet we keep the law because of the commandments.

**2 Nephi 25:26** And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ; and we write according to our prophecies that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.

**2 Nephi 25:27** Wherefore we speak concerning the law, that our children may know the deadness of the law. And they, by knowing the deadness of the law, may look forward unto that life which is in Christ and know for what end the law was given--and after that the law is fulfilled in Christ, that they need not harden their hearts against him when the law had ought to be done away.

**2 Nephi 25:28** And now behold, my people, ye are a stiffnecked people. Wherefore I have spoken plain unto you, that ye cannot misunderstand. And the words which I have spoken shall stand as a testimony against you, for they are sufficient to teach any man the right way. For the right way is to believe in Christ and deny him not, for by denying him ye also deny the prophets and the law.

**2 Nephi 25:29** And now behold, I say unto you that the right way is to believe in Christ and deny him not. And Christ is the Holy One of Israel; wherefore ye must bow down before him and worship him with all your might, mind, and strength, and your whole soul. And if ye do this, ye shall in no wise be cast out.

**2 Nephi 25:30** And inasmuch as it shall be expedient, ye must keep the performances and ordinances of God until the law shall be fulfilled which was given unto Moses.
