**2 Nephi 19:1** Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grieviously afflict by the way of the Red Sea, beyond Jordan in Galilee of the nations.

**2 Nephi 19:2** The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light. They that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.

**2 Nephi 19:3** Thou hast multiplied the nation and increased the joy. They joy before thee according to the joy in harvest and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.

**2 Nephi 19:4** For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor.

**2 Nephi 19:5** For every battle of the warrior with confused noise and garments rolled in blood--but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.

**2 Nephi 19:6** For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given. And the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.

**2 Nephi 19:7** Of the increase of government and peace there is no end, upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom, to order it and to establish it, with judgment and with justice from henceforth, even forever. The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this.

**2 Nephi 19:8** The Lord sent his word unto Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.

**2 Nephi 19:9** And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, that say in the pride and the stoutness of heart:

**2 Nephi 19:10** The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars.

**2 Nephi 19:11** Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him and join his enemies together,

**2 Nephi 19:12** the Syrians before and the Philistines behind, and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand stretched out still.

**2 Nephi 19:13** For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the Lord of Hosts.

**2 Nephi 19:14** Therefore will the Lord cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush in one day.

**2 Nephi 19:15** The ancient, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.

**2 Nephi 19:16** For the leaders of this people cause them to err, and they that are led of them are destroyed.

**2 Nephi 19:17** Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows. For every one of them is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand stretched out still.

**2 Nephi 19:18** For wickedness burneth as the fire. It shall devour the briars and thorns and shall kindle in the thickets of the forests, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.

**2 Nephi 19:19** Through the wrath of the Lord of Hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire. No man shall spare his brother.

**2 Nephi 19:20** And he shall snatch on the right hand and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied. They shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:

**2 Nephi 19:21** Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh. They together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand stretched out still.
