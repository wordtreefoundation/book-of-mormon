*2 Nephi 7:1* Yea, for thus saith the Lord: Have I put thee away or have I cast thee off forever? For thus saith the Lord: Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement? To whom have I put thee away? Or to which of my creditors have I sold you? Yea, to whom have I sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.

*2 Nephi 7:2* Wherefore when I came, there was no man; when I called, yea, there was none to answer. O house of Israel, is my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea. I make the rivers a wilderness and their fish to stink because the waters are dried up and they dieth because of thirst.

*2 Nephi 7:3* I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.

*2 Nephi 7:4* The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season unto thee, O house of Israel, when ye are weary. He wakeneth morning by morning; he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.

*2 Nephi 7:5* The Lord God hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.

*2 Nephi 7:6* I gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair. I hid not my face from shame and spitting.

*2 Nephi 7:7* For the Lord God will help me, therefore shall I not be confounded. Therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.

*2 Nephi 7:8* And the Lord is near and he justifieth me. Who will contend with me? Let us stand together. Who is mine adversary? Let him come near me, and I will smite him with the strength of my mouth.

*2 Nephi 7:9* For the Lord God will help me. And all they which shall condemn me, behold, all they shall wax old as a garment and the moth shall eat them up.

*2 Nephi 7:10* Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness and hath no light?

*2 Nephi 7:11* Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks, walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks which ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand: ye shall lie down in sorrow.
