**2 Nephi 22:1** And in that day thou shalt say: O Lord, I will praise thee. Though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away and thou comfortedst me.

**2 Nephi 22:2** Behold, God is my salvation. I will trust and not be afraid, for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.

**2 Nephi 22:3** Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.

**2 Nephi 22:4** And in that day shall ye say: Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.

**2 Nephi 22:5** Sing unto the Lord, for he hath done excellent things. This is known in all the earth.

**2 Nephi 22:6** Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
