**Ether 5:1** And now I Moroni have written the words which was commanded me, according to my memory. And I have told you the things which I have sealed up. Therefore touch them not, in order that ye may translate; for that thing is forbidden you except by and by it shall be wisdom in God.

**Ether 5:2** And behold, ye may be privileged that ye may shew the plates unto those who shall assist to bring forth this work.

**Ether 5:3** And unto three shall they be shewn by the power of God; wherefore they shall know of a surety that these things are true.

**Ether 5:4** And in the mouth of three witnesses shall these things be established; and the testimony of three and this work--in the which shall be shewn forth the power of God and also his word, of which the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost beareth record--and all this shall stand as a testimony against the world at the last day.

**Ether 5:5** And if it so be that they repent and come unto the Father in the name of Jesus, they shall be received into the kingdom of God.

**Ether 5:6** And now if I have no authority for these things, judge ye; for ye shall know that I have authority when ye shall see me, and we shall stand before God at the last day. Amen.
