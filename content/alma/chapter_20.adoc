*Alma 20:1* And it came to pass that when they had established a church in that land that king Lamoni desired that Ammon should go with him to the land of Nephi, that he might shew him unto his father.

*Alma 20:2* And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to Ammon, saying: Thou shalt not go up to the land of Nephi, for behold, the king will seek thy life; but thou shalt go to the land of Middoni, for behold, thy brother Aaron and also Muloki and Ammah are in prison.

*Alma 20:3* Now it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he saith unto Lamoni: Behold, my brother and brethren are in prison at Middoni; and I go that I may deliver them.

*Alma 20:4* Now Lamoni saith unto Ammon: I know in the strength of the Lord thou canst do all things. But behold, I will go with thee to the land of Middoni, for the king of the land of Middoni, whose name is Antiomno, is a friend unto me. Therefore I go to the land of Middoni that I may flatter the king of the land and he will cast thy brethren out of prison. Now Lamoni saith unto him: Who told thee that thy brethren were in prison?

*Alma 20:5* And Ammon saith unto him: No one hath told me save it be God; and he said unto me: Go and deliver thy brethren, for they are in prison in the land of Middoni.

*Alma 20:6* Now when Lamoni had heard this, he caused that his servants should make ready his horses and his chariots.

*Alma 20:7* And he saith unto Ammon: Come, I will go with thee down to the land of Middoni, and there I will plead with the king that he will cast thy brethren out of prison.

*Alma 20:8* And it came to pass that as Ammon and Lamoni was a journeying thither that they met the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land.

*Alma 20:9* And behold, the father of Lamoni saith unto him: Why did ye not come to the feast on that great day when I made a feast unto my sons and unto my people?

*Alma 20:10* And he also saith: Whither art thou going with this Nephite, which is one of the children of a liar?

*Alma 20:11* And it came to pass that Lamoni rehearsed unto him whither he was going, for he feared to offend him.

*Alma 20:12* And he also told him all the cause of his tarrying in his own kingdom, that he did not go unto his father to the feast which he had prepared.

*Alma 20:13* And now when Lamoni had rehearsed unto him all these things, behold, to his astonishment his father was angry with him and saith: Lamoni, thou art going to deliver these Nephites, which are sons of a liar; behold, he robbed our fathers. And now his children also are come amongst us that they may by their cunning and their lyings deceive us, that they again may rob us of our property.

*Alma 20:14* Now the father of Lamoni commanded him that he should slay Ammon with the sword; and he also commanded him that he should not go to the land of Middoni, but that he should return with him to the land of Ishmael.

*Alma 20:15* But Lamoni saith unto him: I will not slay Ammon, neither will I return to the land of Ishmael; but I go to the land of Middoni that I may release the brethren of Ammon, for I know that they are just men and holy prophets of the true God.

*Alma 20:16* Now when his father heard these words, he was angry with him, and he drew his sword that he might smite him to the earth.

*Alma 20:17* But Ammon stood forth and saith unto him: Behold, thou shalt not slay thy son. Nevertheless it were better that he should fall than thee, for behold, he hath repented of his sins; but if thou shouldst fall at this time in thine anger, thy soul could not be saved.

*Alma 20:18* And again, it is expedient that thou shouldst forbear, for if thou shouldst slay thy son, he being an innocent man, his blood would cry from the ground to the Lord his God for vengeance to come upon thee, and perhaps thou wouldst lose thy soul.

*Alma 20:19* Now when Ammon had said these words unto him, he answered him, saying: I know that if I should slay my son that I should shed innocent blood, for it is thou that hast sought to destroy him.

*Alma 20:20* And he stretched forth his hand to slay Ammon, but Ammon withstood his blows and also smote his arm that he could not use it.

*Alma 20:21* Now when the king saw that Ammon could slay him, he began to plead with Ammon that he would spare his life.

*Alma 20:22* But Ammon raised his sword and said unto him: Behold, I will smite thee except thou wilt grant unto me that my brethren may be cast out of prison.

*Alma 20:23* Now the king fearing that he should lose his life said: If thou wilt spare me, I will grant unto thee whatsoever thou wilt ask, even to the half of the kingdom.

*Alma 20:24* Now when Ammon saw that he had wrought upon the old king according to his desire, he saith unto him: If thou wilt grant that my brethren may be cast out of prison, and also that Lamoni may retain his kingdom, and that ye be not displeased with him but grant that he may do according to his own desires in whatsoever thing he thinketh, and then will I spare thee; otherwise, I will smite thee to the earth.

*Alma 20:25* Now when Ammon had said these words, the king began to rejoice because of his life.

*Alma 20:26* And when he saw that Ammon had no desires to destroy him, and when he also saw the great love he had for his son Lamoni, he was astonished exceedingly and saith: Because this is all that thou hast desired, that I would release thy brethren and suffer that my son Lamoni should retain his kingdom, behold, I will grant unto you that my son may retain his kingdom from this time and forever, and I will govern him no more.

*Alma 20:27* And I will also grant unto thee that thy brethren may be cast out of prison. And thou and thy brethren may come unto me in my kingdom, for I shall greatly desire to see thee. For the king was greatly astonished at the words which he had spoken, and also at the words which had been spoken by his son Lamoni, therefore he was desirous to learn them.

*Alma 20:28* And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni proceeded on their journey towards the land of Middoni. And it came to pass that Lamoni found favor in the eyes of the king of the land; therefore the brethren of Ammon was brought forth out of prison.

*Alma 20:29* And when Ammon did meet them, he was exceeding sorrowful; for behold, they were naked and their skins were worn exceedingly because of being bound with strong cords. And they also had suffered hunger, thirst, and all kind of afflictions. Nevertheless they were patient in all their sufferings.

*Alma 20:30* And as it happened, it was their lot to have fallen into the hands of a more hardened and a more stiffnecked people. Therefore they would not hearken unto their words, and they had cast them out and had smote them and had driven them from house to house and from place to place even until they had arriven to the land of Middoni. And there they were taken and cast into prison and bound with strong cords and kept in prison for many days and were delivered by Lamoni and Ammon.
