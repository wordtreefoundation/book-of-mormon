*Alma 61:1* Behold, now it came to pass that soon after Moroni had sent his epistle unto the chief governor, he received an epistle from Parhoron the chief governor. And these are the words which he received:

*Alma 61:2* I Parhoron, which art the chief governor of this land, do send these words unto Moroni, the chief captain over the army. Behold, I say unto you Moroni that I do not joy in your great afflictions; yea, it grieves my soul.

*Alma 61:3* But behold, there are those who do joy in your afflictions, yea, insomuch that they have risen up in rebellion against me and also those of my people which are freemen; yea, and those which have risen up are exceeding numerous.

*Alma 61:4* And it is those who have sought to take away the judgment seat from me that have been the cause of this great iniquity. For they have used great flattery; and they have led away the hearts of many people, which will be the cause of sore affliction among us. They have withheld our provisions and have daunted our freemen that they have not come unto you.

*Alma 61:5* And behold, they have driven me out before them. And I have fled to the land of Gideon with as many men as it were possible that I could get.

*Alma 61:6* And behold, I have sent a proclamation throughout this part of the land. And behold, they are flocking to us daily, to their arms, in the defense of their country and their freedom, and to avenge our wrongs.

*Alma 61:7* And they have come unto us, insomuch that those which have rose up in rebellion against us are set at defiance, yea, insomuch that they do fear us and durst not come out against us to battle.

*Alma 61:8* They have got possession of the land, or the city of Zarahemla. They have appointed a king over them; and he hath written unto the king of the Lamanites, in the which he hath joined an alliance with him, in the which alliance he hath agreed to maintain the city of Zarahemla, which maintenance he supposeth will enable the Lamanites to conquer the remainder of the land, and he shall be placed king over this people when they shall be conquered under the Lamanites.

*Alma 61:9* And now in your epistle ye hath censured me, but it mattereth not. I am not angry, but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart. I Parhoron do not seek for power, save only to retain my judgment seat that I may preserve the rights and the liberty of my people. My soul standeth fast in that liberty in the which God hath made us free.

*Alma 61:10* And now behold, we will resist wickedness, even unto bloodshed. We would not shed the blood of the Lamanites if they would stay in their own land.

*Alma 61:11* We would not shed the blood of our brethren if they would not rise up in rebellion and take the sword against us.

*Alma 61:12* We would subject ourselves to the yoke of bondage if it were requisite with the justice of God, or if he should command us so to do.

*Alma 61:13* But behold, he doth not command us that we shall subject ourselves to our enemies, but that we should put our trust in him and he will deliver us.

*Alma 61:14* Therefore my beloved brother Moroni, let us resist evil. And whatsoever evil we cannot resist with our words--yea, such as rebellions and dissensions--let us resist them with our swords, that we may retain our freedom, that we may rejoice in the great privilege of our church and in the cause of our Redeemer and our God.

*Alma 61:15* Therefore come unto me speedily with a few of your men and leave the remainder in the charge of Lehi and Teancum. Give unto them power to conduct the war in that part of the land according to the Spirit of God, which is also the spirit of freedom which is in them.

*Alma 61:16* Behold, I have sent a few provisions unto them, that they may not perish until ye can come unto me.

*Alma 61:17* Gather together whatsoever force ye can upon your march hither; and we will go speedily against those dissenters in the strength of our God, according to the faith which is in us.

*Alma 61:18* And we will take possession of the city of Zarahemla that we may obtain more food to send forth unto Lehi and Teancum. Yea, we will go forth against them in the strength of the Lord, and we will put an end to this great iniquity.

*Alma 61:19* And now Moroni, I do joy in receiving your epistle. For I was somewhat worried concerning what we should do, whether it should be just in us to go against our brethren.

*Alma 61:20* But ye have said: Except they repent, the Lord hath commanded you that ye should go against them.

*Alma 61:21* See that ye strengthen Lehi and Teancum in the Lord. Tell them to fear not, for God will deliver them, yea, and also all those who stand fast in that liberty wherewith God hath made them free. And now I close mine epistle to my beloved brother Moroni.
