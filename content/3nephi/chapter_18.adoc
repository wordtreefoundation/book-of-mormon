*3 Nephi 18:1* And it came to pass that Jesus commanded his disciples that they should bring forth some bread and wine unto him.

*3 Nephi 18:2* And while they were gone for bread and wine, he commanded the multitude that they should sit themselves down upon the earth.

*3 Nephi 18:3* And when the disciples had come with bread and wine, he took of the bread and brake and blessed it, and he gave unto the disciples and commanded that they should eat.

*3 Nephi 18:4* And when they had eat and were filled, he commanded that they should give unto the multitude.

*3 Nephi 18:5* And when the multitude had eaten and were filled, he saith unto the disciples: Behold, there shall one be ordained among you, and to him will I give power that he shall break bread and bless it and give it unto the people of my church, unto all they which shall believe and be baptized in my name.

*3 Nephi 18:6* And this shall ye always observe to do, even as I have done, even as I have broken bread and blessed it and gave it unto you.

*3 Nephi 18:7* And this shall ye do in remembrance of my body, which I have shewn unto you. And it shall be a testimony unto the Father, that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember me, ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.

*3 Nephi 18:8* And it came to pass that when he had said these words, he commanded his disciples that they should take of the wine of the cup and drink of it, and that they should also give unto the multitude that they might drink of it.

*3 Nephi 18:9* And it came to pass that they did so and did drink of it and were filled. And they gave unto the multitude and they did drink and they were filled.

*3 Nephi 18:10* And when the disciples had done this, Jesus saith unto them: Blessed are ye for this thing which ye have done, for this is fulfilling my commandments. And this doth witness unto the Father that ye are willing to do that which I have commanded you.

*3 Nephi 18:31* But if he repenteth not, he shall not be numbered among my people, that he may not destroy my people. For behold, I know my sheep and they are numbered.

*3 Nephi 18:38* And it came to pass that when Jesus had touched them all, there came a cloud and overshadowed the multitude, that they could not see Jesus.

*3 Nephi 18:39* And while they were overshadowed, he departed from them and ascended into heaven. And the disciples saw and did bear record that he ascended again into heaven.
