*2 Nephi 10:1* And now I Jacob speak unto you again, my beloved brethren, concerning this righteous branch of which I have spoken.

*2 Nephi 10:2* For behold, the promises which we have obtained are promises unto us according to the flesh. Wherefore as it hath been shewn unto me that many of our children shall perish in the flesh because of unbelief, nevertheless God will be merciful unto many, and our children shall be restored, that they may come to that which will give them the true knowledge of their Redeemer.

*2 Nephi 10:3* Wherefore as I said unto you, it must needs be expedient that Christ--for in the last night the angel spake unto me that this should be his name--that he should come among the Jews, among they which are the more wicked part of the world. And they shall crucify him--for it behooveth our God--and there is none other nation on earth that would crucify their God.

*2 Nephi 10:4* For should the mighty miracles be wrought among other nations, they would repent and know that he be their God.

*2 Nephi 10:5* But because of priestcrafts and iniquities they at Jerusalem will stiffen their necks against him, that he be crucified.

*2 Nephi 10:6* Wherefore because of their iniquities, destructions, famines, pestilences, and bloodsheds shall come upon them. And they which shall not be destroyed shall be scattered among all nations.

*2 Nephi 10:7* But behold, thus saith the Lord God: When the day cometh that they shall believe in me, that I am Christ, then have I covenanted with their fathers that they shall be restored in the flesh upon the earth unto the lands of their inheritance.

*2 Nephi 10:8* And it shall come to pass that they shall be gathered in from their long dispersion from the isles of the sea and from the four parts of the earth. And the nations of the Gentiles shall be great in the eyes of me, saith God, in carrying them forth to the lands of their inheritance.
