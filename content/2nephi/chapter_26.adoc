*2 Nephi 26:1* And after that Christ shall have risen from the dead, he shall shew himself unto you, my children and my beloved brethren, and the words which he shall speak unto you shall be the law which ye shall do.

*2 Nephi 26:2* For behold, I say unto you that I have beheld that many generations shall pass away and there shall be great wars and contentions among my people.

*2 Nephi 26:3* And after that the Messiah shall come, there shall be signs given unto my people of his birth and also of his death and resurrection.

Wherefore the cry of the blood of the saints shall ascend up to God from the ground against them.
