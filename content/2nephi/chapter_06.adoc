*2 Nephi 6:1* The words of Jacob the brother of Nephi which he spake unto the people of Nephi:

*2 Nephi 6:2* Behold, my beloved brethren, that I Jacob having been called of God and ordained after the manner of his holy order and having been consecrated by my brother Nephi, unto whom ye look as a king or a protector and on whom ye depend for safety, behold, ye know that I have spoken unto you exceeding many things.

*2 Nephi 6:3* Nevertheless I speak unto you again, for I am desirous for the welfare of your souls. Yea, mine anxiety is great for you. And ye yourselves know that it ever has been, for I have exhorted you with all diligence. And I have taught you the words of my father, and I have spoken unto you concerning all things which are written from the creation of the world.

*2 Nephi 6:4* And now behold, I would speak unto you concerning things which are and which are to come. Wherefore I will read you the words of Isaiah, and they are the words which my brother hath desired me that I should speak unto you. And I speak them unto you for your sakes, that ye may learn and glorify the name of your God.

*2 Nephi 6:5* And now the words which I shall read are they which Isaiah spake concerning all the house of Israel. Wherefore they may be likened unto you, for ye are of the house of Israel. And there are many things which have been spoken by Isaiah which may be likened unto you because that ye are of the house of Israel.

*2 Nephi 6:9* Nevertheless the Lord hath shewn unto me that they should return again. And he also hath shewn unto me that the Lord [highlight-orange]#God, the Holy One of Israel, should manifest himself unto them in the flesh.# And after that he should manifest himself, they should scourge him and crucify him, according to the words of the angel which spake it unto me.

*2 Nephi 6:11* Wherefore after they are driven to and fro--for thus saith the angel: Many shall be afflicted in the flesh and shall not be suffered to perish because of the prayers of the faithful--wherefore they shall be scattered and smitten and hated. Nevertheless the Lord will be merciful unto them, that when they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer, they shall be gathered together again to the lands of their inheritance.

*2 Nephi 6:12* And blessed are the Gentiles, they of whom the prophet hath written.

And for this cause the prophet hath written these things.

*2 Nephi 6:13* Wherefore they that fight against Zion and the covenant people of the Lord shall lick up the dust of their feet. And the people of the Lord shall not be ashamed, for the people of the Lord are they which wait for him, for they still wait for the coming of the Messiah.

*2 Nephi 6:14* And behold, according to the words of the prophet, the Messiah will set himself again the second time to recover them. Wherefore he will manifest himself unto them in power and great glory unto the destruction of their enemies, when that day cometh when they shall believe in him. And none will he destroy that believeth in him.
