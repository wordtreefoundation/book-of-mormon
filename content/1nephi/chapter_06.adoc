*1 Nephi 6:1* And now I Nephi do not give the genealogy of my fathers in this part of my record, neither at any time shall I give it after upon these plates which I am writing, for it is given in the record which has been kept by my father; wherefore I do not write it in this work.

*1 Nephi 6:2* For it sufficeth me to say that we are a descendant of Joseph.

*1 Nephi 6:3* And it mattereth not to me that I am particular to give a full account of all the things of my father, for they cannot be written upon these plates, for I desire the room that I may write of the things of God.

*1 Nephi 6:4* For the fullness of mine intent is that I may persuade men to come unto the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob and be saved.

*1 Nephi 6:5* Wherefore the things which are pleasing unto the world I do not write, but the things which are pleasing unto God and unto them which are not of the world.

*1 Nephi 6:6* Wherefore I shall give commandment unto my seed that they shall not occupy these plates with things which are not of worth unto the children of men.
