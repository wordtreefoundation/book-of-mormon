*1 Nephi 3:2* And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying: Behold, I have dreamed a dream in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem.

*1 Nephi 3:3* For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a genealogy of my forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of brass.

*1 Nephi 3:4* Wherefore the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brothers should go unto the house of Laban and seek the records and bring them down hither into the wilderness.

*1 Nephi 3:5* And now behold, thy brothers murmur, saying it is a hard thing which I have required of them. But behold, I have not required it of them, but it is a commandment of the Lord.

*1 Nephi 3:6* Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord because thou hast not murmured.

*1 Nephi 3:7* And it came to pass that I Nephi said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.

*1 Nephi 3:8* And it came to pass that when my father had heard these words, he was exceeding glad, for he knew that I had been blessed of the Lord.

*1 Nephi 3:10* And it came to pass that when we had gone up to the land of Jerusalem, I and my brethren did consult one with another.

*1 Nephi 3:11* And we cast lots which of us should go in unto the house of Laban. And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman. And Laman went in unto the house of Laban, and he talked with him as he sat in his house.

*1 Nephi 3:12* And he desired of Laban the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, which contained the genealogy of my father.

*1 Nephi 3:13* And behold, it came to pass that Laban was angry and thrust him out from his presence, and he would not that he should have the records. Wherefore he said unto him: Behold, thou art a robber and I will slay thee.

*1 Nephi 3:14* But Laman fled out of his presence and told the things which Laban had done unto us. And we began to be exceeding sorrowful, and my brethren were about to return unto my father in the wilderness.

*1 Nephi 3:15* But behold, I said unto them that as the Lord liveth and as we live, we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us.

*1 Nephi 3:16* Wherefore let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord. Therefore let us go down to the land of our father's inheritance. For behold, he left gold and silver and all manner of riches, and all this he hath done because of the commandment.

*1 Nephi 3:17* For he knowing that Jerusalem must be destroyed because of the wickedness of the people

*1 Nephi 3:18* --for behold, they have rejected the words of the prophets--wherefore if my father should dwell in the land after that he hath been commanded to flee out of the land, behold, he would also perish; wherefore it must needs be that he flee out of the land.

*1 Nephi 3:19* And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these records that we might preserve unto our children the language of our fathers,

*1 Nephi 3:29* And it came to pass as they smote us with a rod, behold, an angel of the Lord came and stood before them, and he spake unto them, saying: Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod? Know ye not that the Lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over you?--and this because of your iniquities. Behold, thou shalt go up to Jerusalem again, and the Lord will deliver Laban into your hands.

*1 Nephi 3:30* And after that the angel had spake unto us, he departed.

*1 Nephi 3:31* And after that the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again began to murmur, saying: How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man and he can command fifty. Yea, even he can slay fifty, then why not us?
