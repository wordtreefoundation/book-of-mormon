*3 Nephi 13:1* Verily verily I say that I would that ye should do alms unto the poor. But take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them. Otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.

*3 Nephi 13:2* Therefore when ye shall do your alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as will hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you: They have their reward.

*3 Nephi 13:3* But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth,

*3 Nephi 13:4* that thine alms may be in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in secret, himself shall reward thee openly.

*3 Nephi 13:5* And when thou prayest, thou shalt not do as the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you: They have their reward.

*3 Nephi 13:6* But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet. And when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father, which is in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.

*3 Nephi 13:7* But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions as the heathen, for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.

*3 Nephi 13:8* Be not ye therefore like unto them, for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him.

*3 Nephi 13:9* After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

*3 Nephi 13:10* Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.

*3 Nephi 13:11* And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.

*3 Nephi 13:12* And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil,

*3 Nephi 13:13* for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.

*3 Nephi 13:14* For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.

*3 Nephi 13:15* But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

*3 Nephi 13:16* Moreover, when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites of a sad countenance, for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you: They have their reward.

*3 Nephi 13:17* But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head and wash thy face,

*3 Nephi 13:18* that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy Father, which is in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.

*3 Nephi 13:19* Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt and thieves break through and steal.

*3 Nephi 13:20* But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.

*3 Nephi 13:21* For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

*3 Nephi 13:22* The light of the body is the eye. If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.

*3 Nephi 13:23* But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!

*3 Nephi 13:24* No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

*3 Nephi 13:25* And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he looked upon the twelve whom he had chosen and saith unto them: Remember the words which I have spoken, for behold, ye are they which I have chosen to minister unto this people. Therefore I say unto you: Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink, nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment?

*3 Nephi 13:26* Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do they reap nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?

*3 Nephi 13:27* Which of you, by taking thought, can add one cubit unto his stature?

*3 Nephi 13:28* And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They toil not, neither do they spin.

*3 Nephi 13:29* And yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

*3 Nephi 13:30* Wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field--which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven--even so will he clothe you, if ye are not of little faith.

*3 Nephi 13:31* Therefore take no thought, saying: What shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed?

*3 Nephi 13:32* For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

*3 Nephi 13:33* But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.

*3 Nephi 13:34* Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient is the day unto the evil thereof.
