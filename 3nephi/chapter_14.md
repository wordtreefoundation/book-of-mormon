**3 Nephi 14:1** And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he turned again to the multitude and did open his mouth unto them again, saying: Verily verily I say unto you: Judge not that ye be not judged.

**3 Nephi 14:2** For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged. And with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

**3 Nephi 14:3** And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

**3 Nephi 14:4** Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye--and behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

**3 Nephi 14:5** Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.

**3 Nephi 14:6** Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you.

**3 Nephi 14:7** Ask and it shall be given unto you; seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you.

**3 Nephi 14:8** For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

**3 Nephi 14:9** Or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?

**3 Nephi 14:10** Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

**3 Nephi 14:11** If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?

**3 Nephi 14:12** Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets.

**3 Nephi 14:13** Enter ye in at the strait gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction. And many there be which go in thereat,

**3 Nephi 14:14** because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

**3 Nephi 14:15** Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

**3 Nephi 14:16** Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles?

**3 Nephi 14:17** Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

**3 Nephi 14:18** A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

**3 Nephi 14:19** Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.

**3 Nephi 14:20** Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.

**3 Nephi 14:21** Not every one that saith unto me, Lord Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.

**3 Nephi 14:22** Many will say to me in that day: Lord Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works?

**3 Nephi 14:23** And then will I profess unto them: I never knew you. Depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

**3 Nephi 14:24** Therefore whoso heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock.

**3 Nephi 14:25** And the rain descended and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house. And it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.

**3 Nephi 14:26** And every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand.

**3 Nephi 14:27** And the rain descended and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house. And it fell, and great was the fall of it.
